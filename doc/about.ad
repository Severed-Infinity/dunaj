Dunaj `/ˈdunaɪ/` is a set of <<guide.ad#,core language experiments>>
aimed to improve Clojure language and its core API. Dunaj is an
effort to bring Clojure even more towards *simplicity*,
*consistency* and *performance*.

Dunaj API is intended to be used by regular Clojure developers,
either for application or library development.
Bootstrapping, implementation details and other low level stuff are
left in clojure.core and still accessible for the brave ones.

Dunaj is not a library, but rather a fork of Clojure,
as changes to the Clojure itself were required. The changes to
Clojure are hovewer minimal and most of Dunaj is implemented as
a separate library. A dedicated project called
http://lite.dunaj.org[Dunaj lite] provides a library-only subset
of Dunaj, that can be used with ordinary Clojure. The set of features
provided by Dunaj lite is nearly identical to ones offered by Dunaj.

Dunaj integrates well with Clojure. Most of existing Clojure
libraries and tools can be used from Dunaj without any changes.
Dunaj provides a comprehensive <<doc.ad#,documentation>> including
design notes, <<spec.ad#,specification>> and documentation for its
<<api.ad#,API>> and <<spi.ad#,SPI>>. Dunaj has been worked on since
2013 and consists of more than 40k lines of code. It provides 1500
public functions, macros and vars in more than 90 namespaces.
Moreover, more than a hundred public protocols are used to define
virtually every extensible functionality in Dunaj.

*Dunaj implementation is open source. It aims to be fast and stable
enough to be used in a real world projects.
See <<start.ad#,Getting Started>> page on how to include Dunaj in
your project.*
