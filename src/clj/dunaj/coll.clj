  "Immutable, mutable and persistent collections.
  Reducers and transducers icon:puzzle-piece[].
  
  In Dunaj, a collection in a broadest sense is defined as an object
  that implements `<<dunaj.coll.spi.ad#IRed,IRed>>`.
  There are no other requirements for such object.
  In Dunaj, any object is considered a collection as long as
  it is reducible by implementing `IRed` protocol.
  Predicate for such collection is called
  `<<dunaj.coll.api.ad#red{under}QMARK{under},red?>>`.
  Other names for a collection that at least implements `IRed`
  include '`reducible`', '`reducible collection`' or just
  '`a collection`' (last one is the most used in Dunaj docs).
  
  .Major groups of collections
  ****
  In addition to reducible collections, dunaj defines 5 mutually
  exclusive groups of collections:

  [discrete]
  === Immutable collections
  
  - implement `IRed`
  - do not implement `<<dunaj.coll.spi.ad#IPersistentCollection,IPersistentCollection>>`
    nor `<<dunaj.coll.spi.ad#ISeq,ISeq>>`
  - are not persistent
  - can be `<<dunaj.coll.spi.ad#IEditable,IEditable>>` -
    return mutable collection, preferably transient
  - have items stored in memory or lazily evaluated with caching
  - examples: `<<dunaj.string.api.ad#String,String>>`,
    `<<dunaj.host.array.api.ad#adapt,ArrayColl>>` or
    `ImmutableBuffer`

  [discrete]
  === Persistent collections

  - implement `IRed` and `IPersistentCollection`
  - do not implement `ISeq`
  - can be `IEditable` - return mutable collection, preferably
    transient
  - have items stored in memory or lazily evaluated with caching
  ** in later case, time guarantees may not be met on a first call,
     when lazy parts of the collection are realized.
  - examples: `<<dunaj.coll.array-map.api.ad#,ArrayMap>>`,
    `<<dunaj.coll.bvt-vector.api.ad#,BvtVector>>`

  [discrete]
  === Seqs
  
  - implement `IRed`, `IPersistentCollection` and `ISeq`
  - are usually wrappers on top of other collections
  - have items stored in memory or lazily evaluated with caching
  - examples: `<<dunaj.coll.linked-list.api.ad,LinkedList>>`,
    `<<dunaj.coll.lazy-seq.api.ad#,Lazy>>`,
    `<<dunaj.coll.cons-seq.api.ad#,Cons>>`

  [discrete]
  === Mutable collections
  
  - do not necessarily implement `IRed`
  - if implement `IRed`, must also be
    `<<dunaj.concurrent.thread.spi.ad#IThreadLocal,IThreadLocal>>` or
    `<<dunaj.coll.spi.ad#ISnapshoatable,ISnapshotable>>`
  - implement some mutable protocols, usually
    `<<dunaj.coll.spi.ad#IMutableCollection,IMutableCollection>>`
  - can be `<<dunaj.coll.spi.ad#ISettleable,ISettleable>>`
    or `ISnapshotable`
  - transient collections are mutable collections that implement
    at least `IRed`, `IThreadLocal` and `ISettleable`
  - examples: collections created with `<<edit!,edit!>>`,
    concurrent hash-trie, ``<<dunaj.buffer.api.ad#buffer,Buffer>>``

  [discrete]
  === Collection recipes

  - implement `IRed`
  - do not implement `IPersistentCollecion` or `IMutableCollection`
  - no items stored in memory, recompute for each reduce
  - may give different results for same reduce calls, when e.g.
    connected to a resource, represent a random number generator
    or when the computation they perform takes values from
    some reference or mutable collection.
  - can represent input from a resource, performing I/O
    operations when reduced. Such collections must be
    reduced within <<dunaj.state.api.ad#io!,dunaj.state/io!>> block.
  - examples:
  ** results from reducers
     (`<<dunaj.coll.recipe.api.ad#concat,concat>>`,
     `<<dunaj.coll.recipe.api.ad#append,append>>`, ...)
  ** generators (`<<dunaj.coll.recipe.api.ad#range,range>>`,
     `<<dunaj.coll.recipe.api.ad#repeat,repeat>>`,
     `<<dunaj.coll.recipe.api.ad#cycle,cycle>>`, ...)
  ** input from resources (`<<dunaj.resource.api.ad#read!,read!>>`)
  ****

  Host or third party collections can be easily integrated with
  Dunaj collections by extending `IRed` (and optionally other
  Dunaj collection protocols). Standard host collections are already
  supported, and extensions are available for host interfaces too
  (e.g. http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/List.html[`j.u.List`], http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html[`j.u.Collection`] on JVM)
  
  A host array is not considered a collection.
  Use `<<dunaj.host.array.api.ad#adapt,dunaj.host.array/adapt>>`
  function to transform array into a Dunaj collection variant.
  
  [NOTE]
  --
  Every collection which implements `IRed` is seqable
  (transformable to `ISeq`) in O(1).
  
  Docstrings mention what kind of collection they expect or provide:
  
  * e.g. if docstring states that a function accepts a collection,
    user can pass any object implementing `IRed`
  * pay attention to what kind of collection a function produces
    (e.g. `<<dunaj.coll.recipe.api.ad#map,map>>`,
    `<<dunaj.coll.recipe.api.ad#take,take>>` or
    `<<dunaj.coll.recipe.api.ad#filter,filter>>`
    all return collection recipes!)
