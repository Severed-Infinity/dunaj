  "Refs, a transactional references that use software transactional
  memory (STM) for safe shared use of mutable references.

  Refs allow mutation to occur only within a transaction.
  Transactions ensure that all actions on Refs are atomic,
  consistent, and isolated.

  IMPORTANT: Transactions are retried in case a conflict arises, so
  the code inside transactions should be I/O and side-effect free.
  Note that agents play nicely with transactions, as sends from
  within a transaction are dispatched only when the transaction
  is successful.

  NOTE: Refs are abstracted into `IRef` protocol,
  as there can be multiple implementations of Refs (e.g. cgrand's
  https://github.com/cgrand/megaref[Megarefs])"

(defalias ref
  "Creates and returns a Ref with an initial value of `_x_` and zero
  or more options:

  * `:meta metadata-map` - If supplied, it will become the metadata
    on the ref.
  * `:validator validate-fn` - must be `nil` or a side-effect-free fn
    of one argument, which will be passed the intended new state on
    any state change. If the new state is unacceptable, the
    validate-fn should return `false` or throw an exception.
    validate-fn will be called on transaction commit, when all
    refs have their final values.
  * `:min-history (default 0) :max-history (default 10)` - Normally
    refs accumulate history dynamically as needed to deal with read
    demands. If you know in advance you will need history you can
    set `:min-history` to ensure it will be available when first
    needed (instead of after a read fault). History is limited,
    and the limit can be set with `:max-history`.

  History parameters can be later changed through ref's mutable
  configuration. Validator may be also set and managed through its
  functions in <<dunaj.feature.api.ad#,dunaj.feature>> namespace."
