     it is evaluated, and the root binding of the var is set to the
     resulting value. If initial value is not supplied, the root
     binding of the var is unaffected.

     `def` always applies to the root binding, even if the var is
     thread-bound at the point where def is called. `_name_` is an
     unqualified `Symbol`. Metadata from `_name_` is used as a
     metadata of the var. Rest of arguments (args) are parsed for
     docstring and attribute map, which are merged with vars metadata.

     Throws an exception if `_name_` symbol is already in the
