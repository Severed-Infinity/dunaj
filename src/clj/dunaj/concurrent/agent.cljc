(ns dunaj.concurrent.agent
  "Agents, a reference object to the result of an asynchronous
  computation, with additional distinctive features.

  Action is a function that will be called with agent's old state and
  the value it produces will be the new state of an agent. Actions
  are 'sent' to the agents with `<<send_BANG_,send!>>` function and
  its variants. There are additional features which are specific to
  agents' actions:

  * Actions sent to the agent are enqueued and dispatched
    consecutively.
  * Action which throws an exception sets the agent into the failed
    state. The failed state may be later restarted and not yet
    dispatched actions will continue to process the agent's state.
    See `<<restart_agent_BANG_,restart-agent!>>` for details.
  * Agent's state may be observed by
    <<dunaj.concurrent.port.api.ad#tap_BANG_,tapping>>
    into the agent and validated with a custom validator function.

  [NOTE]
  Actions to the agent may be dispatched even in a ref transaction.
  In that case, the actual sending is postponed until the transaction
  completes. This is done to avoid multiple sends when a transaction
  restarts.

  [NOTE]
  Another special case is the sending of an action while currently
  in an action. In that case, the sends to any agent are postponed
  until current action completes. See
  `<<release_pending_sends_BANG_,release-pending-sends!>>` for
  details. Note that pending sends are not dispatched if the action
  fails."
