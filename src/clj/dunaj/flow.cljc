  Treats last argument as an implicit else, if number of arguments is

  `cond` supports several modifiers:

  * `:let` - treats `expr` as a binding vec and establishes custom

  * `:when` - immediatelly returns `nil` if `expr` does not evaluate
    to logical `true`. Continues with the rest of pairs otherwise.
  * `:when-let` - similar to `:when`, but treats `expr` as an input

  The recur expression must match the arity of the recursion point
  exactly. In particular, if the recursion point was the top of a
  variadic fn method, there is no gathering of rest args - a single
  seq (or null) should be passed. recur in other than a tail
  position is an error.

  NOTE: `recur` is the only non-stack-consuming looping construct
