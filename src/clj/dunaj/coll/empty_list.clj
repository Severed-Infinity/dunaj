(ns dunaj.coll.empty-list
  "Empty list, a seq type.

  This namespace defines a type for object which extends
  `<<dunaj.coll.spi.ad#IPersistentList,IPersistentList>>`
  and has no items. CLJ format defines syntax for empty list
  literal, `()`.

  Note that persistent lists are a type of LIFO collections.
  They are seqs, are counted and support `pop`.
  Calling `pop` on empty list will however result in an exception
  being thrown.

  IMPORTANT: Except for very special cases, it is idiomatic to use
  `nil` rather than `empty-list`."
