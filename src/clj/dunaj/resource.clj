(ns dunaj.resource
  "Computer and network resources, systems, scopes.

  WARNING: dunaj.resource API is a very early experiment with
           incomplete functionality. Expect rough edges.

  Basic characteristics of a resource is its limited availability
  within a computer system. Additional informations are available in
  the <<resources.ad#,resource specification>>.
  
  User acquires a resource with acquire! function. Resource
  is a stateful object and is released within a given scope.
  Resource can be in one of following states:
  
  * OPEN (dunaj.state/open?)
  * FAILED (dunaj.error/error)
  * CANCELLED (dunaj.state/cancelled?)
  * CLOSED (not observable)
  * RELEASING (not observable)
  
  State transitions:
  
  * after acquiring: OPEN or FAILED
  * when working with resource: OPEN -> OPEN, OPEN -> FAILED
  * evaluation hits end of scope: OPEN -> RELEASING
  * after release is done: RELEASING -> CLOSED, RELEASING -> FAILED
  * cancelling the release process: RELEASING -> CANCELLED.
  
  NOTE: Resources with composite bands implement classic collection
  protocols (IIndexed, ILookup, ICounted). Resources where
  individuals items can be sent/received implement ISourcePort
  and ITargetPort. If resource contains single value, it can
  implement IReference or IBlockingReference.
  Resources can implement custom error handling."
