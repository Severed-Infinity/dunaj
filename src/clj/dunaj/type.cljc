(ns dunaj.type
  "Type signatures. Provides basic facilities for declaring data
  types for vars, function arguments and return values.

  Type signatures can be used for any object which can have metadata,
  and are stored in object's metadata under `:tsig` key.
  In addition, type signatures can be used in
  binding/arg vectors of `let`, `fn` and `loop`.

  Special syntax sugar `:-` for type signatures is also available.
  If possible, host type hints are generated automatically from
  type signatures, so that user does not have to specify types twice.

  Following macros recognize type signatures, support sugared syntax
  and generate type hints:
  `def`, `defonce`, `defn`, `defnonce`, `deftype`, `defrecord` and
  `defprotocol` (in methods).

  Following macros recognize sugared syntax
  and generate type hints, but do not store type signatures in
  metadata: `fn`, `let`, `if-let`, `when-let`, `loop`, `iloop`.
  For these cases, type checking library must get type signatures
  from static analysis of source files.

  WARNING: dunaj.type API is a very early experiment with
           incomplete functionality. Expect rough edges.

  IMPORTANT: Dunaj does not include type checking facilities,
  as these are left to third party libraries, which can
  utilize and extend type signatures defined here.

  .Notes
  ****
  * `[x y z ...]` denotes any collection, items of which
    must satisfy type signatures x y z ... If no special modifiers
    (e.g. `required`) are used, items are optional and collection
    may even be empty or `nil`.
  * `{k1 v1, k2 v2, ...}` denotes collection transformable
    to the sequence of key-value pairs that satisfy type signatures
    k1 v1, k2 v2, ... If no special modifiers are used, keys are
    optional and collection may even be empty or `nil`. Values for
    optional key may also be `nil`, even if this is not indicated in
    the value signature.
  * `[]` is equivalent to `(Maybe dunaj.coll/IRed)`
  * `{}` is equivalent to `(Maybe dunaj.coll/IPersistentMap)`
  * `#{}` is equivalent to `(Maybe dunaj.coll/IPersistentSet)`
