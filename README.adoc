Dunaj `/ˈdunaɪ/` is a set of core language experiments
aimed to improve Clojure language and its core API. Dunaj is an
effort to bring Clojure even more towards *simplicity*,
*consistency* and *performance*.

Dunaj API is intended to be used by regular Clojure developers,
either for application or library development.
Bootstrapping, implementation details and other low level stuff are
left in `clojure.core` and still accessible for the brave ones.

Dunaj is not a library, but rather a fork of Clojure,
as changes to the Clojure itself were required. The changes to
Clojure are hovewer minimal and most of Dunaj is implemented as
a separate library.

Dunaj integrates well with Clojure. Most of existing Clojure
libraries and tools can be used from Dunaj without any changes.
Dunaj implementation is open source. It aims to be fast and stable
enough to be used in real world projects.
